You can hear my cat playing with these toys. Oh well. I just thought I'd update on my skin. It's got a lot worse I think this week. On my cheeks. It's just really sore. There's not really a lot that can be done. So I have been referred to dermatology within my local hospital and I'm also booked into C.G.P. to see if there's anything they can give me like topical treatments like creams. But it's really getting me down now because it's so sore and it's all because of this new medication or partisans. And it's really bad. Like I've not had acne like this ever. Like it's going to do some serious scar into my skin. And because basically I'm in kind of not in remission for my Crohn's but it's helping the symptoms a lot by the looks of things. But again it's the side effects and I can't go anymore. I don't think I can go any more treatment or just want my treatment because I've been on basically for biologics now. So yeah it's getting me down and it's sore. And I'm trying like I don't think it's just basically the medication and what I'm ever putting on it it kind of settles it a little bit. I'm using Sarah's ink and LaRache-Posay stuff. And I'm using Bare Minerals Foundation. So I'm using products that are you know suited to blemish prone skin. But yeah I know people have got it worse but it's sore and I just feel a bit inadequate moaning about my skin when there's loads going on in the world. But yeah it's getting me down a bit and I feel like I need to vent about it. And acne is horrible. It's really really bad. It's really messes with your mind, your confidence. And yeah I just feel a bit lost. I hope everyone is doing well and if you're going for a flare-up or anything health related at the moment.

I don't know, because I've been having so many other problems with like the POTS diagnosis and everything else, like my heart has just been like the only thing on my minds lately. So I can't tell, because I'm still in pain all the time. I have really bad arthritis, like especially my fingers and hands, or duh, same thing. Wrists, my ankles, especially it's so hard to walk after a while. What else? My feet are always fucking cold. My hands are always cold. But I don't know. Another thing I wanted to point out, I've been dealing with this weird, undiagnosed POTS symptoms since... I've been writing about it in my journal since June of... well, this year. But that end of June. I started my journal. And I was talking about all these symptoms. My heart is racing. It almost feels like anxiety, but it's so much worse. And it's every time I sit up, or get up out of bed, or walk, any type of exercise, movement, anything. It's fucking horrible. But every time I go to the hospital, because I'm severely dehydrated, they just give me fluids and go tell me I'm fine. But this time around, they admitted me, because I've gone in for the same fucking thing over and over and over again. And I went last week to the hospital for that exact same thing. So they wanted to admit me and see what the fuck was going on. I stayed for four days. And they said, it's POTS, but that was about it. My heart is fine. Nothing is wrong with my heart. It's the heart rate. So let's see what the cardiologist says when I see him again on, I don't know, 1. There's a lot of crazy ass side effects of RINVOC. So I was really wondering if the RINVOC was the cause of the POTS being so bad all of a sudden. But it wasn't the RINVOC. I've just been in a really bad flare lately, I guess. I don't really know other things to say other than, I don't feel anything after two weeks. Oh, and it's not the POTS doing it. So the medication is fine.

I don't know if I notice a difference, to be honest with you. I don't know, because I've been having so many other problems with like the POTS diagnosis and everything else, like my heart has just been like the only thing on my minds lately. So I can't tell, because I'm still in pain all the time. I have really bad arthritis, like especially my fingers and hands, or duh, same thing. Wrists, my ankles, especially it's so hard to walk after a while. What else? My feet are always fucking cold. My hands are always cold. But I don't know. Another thing I wanted to point out, I've been dealing with this weird, undiagnosed POTS symptoms since... I've been writing about it in my journal since June of... well, this year. But that end of June. I started my journal. And I was talking about all these symptoms. My heart is racing. It almost feels like anxiety, but it's so much worse. And it's every time I sit up, or get up out of bed, or walk, any type of exercise, movement, anything. It's fucking horrible. But every time I go to the hospital, because I'm severely dehydrated, they just give me fluids and go tell me I'm fine. But this time around, they admitted me, because I've gone in for the same fucking thing over and over and over again. And I went last week to the hospital for that exact same thing. So they wanted to admit me and see what the fuck was going on. I stayed for four days. And they said, it's POTS, but that was about it. My heart is fine. Nothing is wrong with my heart. It's the heart rate. So let's see what the cardiologist says when I see him again on, I don't know, 1. There's a lot of crazy ass side effects of RINVOC. So I was really wondering if the RINVOC was the cause of the POTS being so bad all of a sudden. But it wasn't the RINVOC. I've just been in a really bad flare lately, I guess. I don't really know other things to say other than, I don't feel anything after two weeks. Oh, and it's not the POTS doing it. So the medication is fine. I haven't noticed any weird side effects or anything.",so it is day 15 of rinvoc so i finished a complete two weeks i dont know if i notice a difference to be honest with you i dont know because ive been having so many other problems with like the pots diagnosis and everything else like my heart has just been like the only thing on my minds lately so i cant tell because im still in pain all the time i have really bad arthritis like especially my fingers and hands or duh same thing wrists my ankles especially its so hard to walk after a while what else my feet are always fucking cold my hands are always cold but i dont know another thing i wanted to point out ive been dealing with this weird undiagnosed pots symptoms since ive been writing about it in my journal since june of well this year but that end of june i started my journal and i was talking about all these symptoms my heart is racing it almost feels like anxiety but its so much worse and its every time i sit up or get up out of bed or walk any type of exercise movement anything its fucking horrible but every time i go to the hospital because im severely dehydrated they just give me fluids and go tell me im fine but this time around they admitted me because ive gone in for the same fucking thing over and over and over again and i went last week to the hospital for that exact same thing so they wanted to admit me and see what the fuck was going on i stayed for four days and they said its pots but that was about it my heart is fine nothing is wrong with my heart its the heart rate so lets see what the cardiologist says when i see him again on i dont know 1 theres a lot of crazy ass side effects of rinvoc so i was really wondering if the rinvoc was the cause of the pots being so bad all of a sudden but it wasnt the rinvoc ive just been in a really bad flare lately i guess i dont really know other things to say other than i dont feel anything after two weeks oh and its not the pots doing it so the medication is fine i havent noticed any weird side effects or anything,https://www.tiktok.com/@angela00fern/video/7207994255552564526,OMG I said June but I meant January!!

Now we've got some actual daylight. I feel like I always do my videos at night and the actual daylight is awful and you can't really see things clearly on my skin. So yeah as you can see like I feel like my skin acne-wise has improved quite a lot and I found that the Jack inhibitor that I'm currently on up at the SNIP it caused me to have a lot of acne initially. Now it has calmed down however there is still quite a lot of scarring. I had a conversation with the dermatologist because I was on quite a lot of different biological drugs over the past couple of years. I noticed that my skin was never right or it was always spotty, always a breakout and it turns out that a lot of the side effects from those type of drugs caused breakouts. So at the moment I'm still waiting to hear back from the dermatologist about going in for a routine. Even though my skin looks alright at the minute in terms of like acne there's not really an active breakout. I've got a few little pimples here. I still feel that she'll probably put me on it if the consultant allows me to go into that because they have to get approval from my consultant to make sure that it obviously is in alignment with the up at SNIP or the Jack inhibitor that I'm on. So I've got another appointment coming up in March with the dermatologist however. Over the past few weeks I've noticed I've also had psoriasis in the past as well. I've been in the dermatology for psoriasis quite a few years ago where it was really bad. I had guttate psoriasis, like I'm 50% of my body on my face. It was awful, awful awful awful and that was due to a lot of different things like stress, a breakup, a Crohn's medication, lots of different things. However I've noticed I've started to develop psoriasis on my face. I can't seem to have a break with my skin at the moment and even though it's only slightly you can still see like here and here and here and I had some Botox the other day I'm not gonna lie because I'm not that type of person and you can see some little bruises if in case anyone's wondering what the bruises were about that's just from the Botox but yeah if anyone else has been having issues with their skin just reach out because it's doing my head in so much like I have the acne's gone well not gone but it's calmed down and now the psoriasis has started and I was gonna go to my GP this morning to go and maybe get some hydrocarotidones or like a steroid cream for my skin because normally it just calms it down a little bit but I don't really like using steroid creams on my face and it can make it worse it's made it worse in the past but I thought you know what just to kind of get rid of it because it's not really bad at the moment but no I can't get an appointment but yeah it's just a little bit of a checking really I hope you're all doing well I've not really been posting very much just because I've been so busy and there's not really much to report on at the moment in terms of my Crohn's however I did go out for food last night with my mum I had like a really nice Sunday roast and I was so poorly when I got in like I was going to the toilet I had severe cramps I was up in the night so I'm feeling pretty drained today but yeah having Crohn's sucks because you think I'm alright and then you have food that doesn't agree with you and then you have a light and

I don't know, because I've been having so many other problems with like the POTS diagnosis and everything else, like my heart has just been like the only thing on my minds lately. So I can't tell, because I'm still in pain all the time. I have really bad arthritis, like especially my fingers and hands, or duh, same thing. Wrists, my ankles, especially it's so hard to walk after a while. What else? My feet are always fucking cold. My hands are always cold. But I don't know. Another thing I wanted to point out, I've been dealing with this weird, undiagnosed POTS symptoms since... I've been writing about it in my journal since June of... well, this year. But that end of June. I started my journal. And I was talking about all these symptoms. My heart is racing. It almost feels like anxiety, but it's so much worse. And it's every time I sit up, or get up out of bed, or walk, any type of exercise, movement, anything. It's fucking horrible. But every time I go to the hospital, because I'm severely dehydrated, they just give me fluids and go tell me I'm fine.

So I was really wondering if the RINVOC was the cause of the POTS being so bad all of a sudden. But it wasn't the RINVOC. I've just been in a really bad flare lately, I guess. I don't really know other things to say other than, I don't feel anything after two weeks. Oh, and it's not the POTS doing it. So the medication is fine. I haven't noticed any weird side effects or anything.",so it is day 15 of rinvoc so i finished a complete two weeks i dont know if i notice a difference to be honest with you i dont know because ive been having so many other problems with like the pots diagnosis and everything else like my heart has just been like the only thing on my minds lately so i cant tell because im still in pain all the time i have really bad arthritis like especially my fingers and hands or duh same thing wrists my ankles especially its so hard to walk after a while what else my feet are always fucking cold my hands are always cold but i dont know another thing i wanted to point out ive been dealing with this weird undiagnosed pots symptoms since ive been writing about it in my journal since june of well this year but that end of june i started my journal and i was talking about all these symptoms my heart is racing it almost feels like anxiety but its so much worse and its every time i sit up or get up out of bed or walk any type of exercise movement anything its fucking horrible but every time i go to the hospital because im severely dehydrated they just give me fluids and go tell me im fine but this time around they admitted me because ive gone in for the same fucking thing over and over and over again and i went last week to the hospital for that exact same thing so they wanted to admit me and see what the fuck was going on i stayed for four days and they said its pots but that was about it my heart is fine nothing is wrong with my heart its the heart rate so lets see what the cardiologist says when i see him again on i dont know 1 theres a lot of crazy ass side effects of rinvoc so i was really wondering if the rinvoc was the cause of the pots being so bad all of a sudden but it wasnt the rinvoc ive just been in a really bad flare lately i guess i dont really know other things to say other than i dont feel anything after two weeks oh and its not the pots doing it so the medication is fine i havent noticed any weird side effects or anything,https://www.tiktok.com/@angela00fern/video/7207994255552564526,I have AS too.

I don't know if I notice a difference, to be honest with you. I don't know, because I've been having so many other problems with like the POTS diagnosis and everything else, like my heart has just been like the only thing on my minds lately. So I can't tell, because I'm still in pain all the time. I have really bad arthritis, like especially my fingers and hands, or duh, same thing. Wrists, my ankles, especially it's so hard to walk after a while. What else? My feet are always fucking cold. My hands are always cold. But I don't know. Another thing I wanted to point out, I've been dealing with this weird, undiagnosed POTS symptoms since... I've been writing about it in my journal since June of... well, this year. But that end of June. I started my journal. And I was talking about all these symptoms. My heart is racing. It almost feels like anxiety, but it's so much worse. And it's every time I sit up, or get up out of bed, or walk, any type of exercise, movement, anything. It's fucking horrible. But every time I go to the hospital, because I'm severely dehydrated, they just give me fluids and go tell me I'm fine. But this time around, they admitted me, because I've gone in for the same fucking thing over and over and over again. And I went last week to the hospital for that exact same thing. So they wanted to admit me and see what the fuck was going on. I stayed for four days. And they said, it's POTS, but that was about it. My heart is fine. Nothing is wrong with my heart.

Now we've got some actual daylight. I feel like I always do my videos at night and the actual daylight is awful and you can't really see things clearly on my skin. So yeah as you can see like I feel like my skin acne-wise has improved quite a lot and I found that the Jack inhibitor that I'm currently on up at the SNIP it caused me to have a lot of acne initially. Now it has calmed down however there is still quite a lot of scarring. I had a conversation with the dermatologist because I was on quite a lot of different biological drugs over the past couple of years. I noticed that my skin was never right or it was always spotty, always a breakout and it turns out that a lot of the side effects from those type of drugs caused breakouts. So at the moment I'm still waiting to hear back from the dermatologist about going in for a routine. Even though my skin looks alright at the minute in terms of like acne there's not really an active breakout. I've got a few little pimples here. I still feel that she'll probably put me on it if the consultant allows me to go into that because they have to get approval from my consultant to make sure that it obviously is in alignment with the up at SNIP or the Jack inhibitor that I'm on. So I've got another appointment coming up in March with the dermatologist however. Over the past few weeks I've noticed I've also had psoriasis in the past as well. I've been in the dermatology for psoriasis quite a few years ago where it was really bad. I had guttate psoriasis, like I'm 50% of my body on my face. It was awful, awful awful awful and that was due to a lot of different things like stress, a breakup, a Crohn's medication, lots of different things. However I've noticed I've started to develop psoriasis on my face. I can't seem to have a break with my skin at the moment and even though it's only slightly you can still see like here and here and here and I had some Botox the other day I'm not gonna lie because I'm not that type of person and you can see some little bruises if in case anyone's wondering what the bruises were about that's just from the Botox but yeah if anyone else has been having issues with their skin just reach out because it's doing my head in so much like I have the acne's gone well not gone but it's calmed down and now the psoriasis has started and I was gonna go to my GP this morning to go and maybe get some hydrocarotidones or like a steroid cream for my skin because normally it just calms it down a little bit but I don't really like using steroid creams on my face and it can make it worse it's made it worse in the past but I thought you know what just to kind of get rid of it because it's not really bad at the moment but no I can't get an appointment but yeah it's just a little bit of a checking really I hope you're all doing well I've not really been posting very much just because I've been so busy and there's not really much to report on at the moment in terms of my Crohn's however I did go out for food last night with my mum I had like a really nice Sunday roast and I was so poorly when I got in like I was going to the toilet I had severe cramps I was up in the night so I'm feeling pretty drained today but yeah having Crohn's sucks because you think I'm alright and then you have food that doesn't agree with you and then you have a light and really bad stomach ache and it's so painful but yeah I'm rabbitting um see ya",hi everyone i just thought i would quickly check in now weve got some actual daylight i feel like i always do my videos

Oh that's better isn't it? okay so I'm just about to go out and I thought by my window would be really good for lighting so I'm gonna film here but yeah just to check in really do a skin update do just like a little life update and yeah just to check in really Happy New Year I don't think I actually said that but you're happy New Year and I hope you have all have a healthy and happy 2024 now I just wanted to check in my skin so I've got make-up on now but it's actually I'm having a really good skin day and the past couple of days my skin's been pretty good and I've been using benzo peroxide and I've been using quite a lot of the La Roche-Posay products for blemish-prone skin but I think what has kind of really helped is definitely the benzo peroxide it's a 5% face gel that I use and you can get it from like any pharmacy chemists drugstore maybe the supermarket as well but yeah that aside I just wanted to touch on basically my mental health how I've been feeling on the back of the hellhole that was last year yeah I think it's been difficult and the past well 2023 is very difficult but also really good as well so it's quite bit sweet but what I wanted to say is like my mental health has probably been quite bad and especially over December and November time I was having counseling through work like yeah flight six free sessions which actually very you know really helped I was also doing a counseling graduate schools and counseling course because I wanted to train to become a counselor this year when I do my masters so I had to do that before going on to the masters course so that was bringing up a lot of stuff and the course itself because obviously it's due with self-development and you as a person so that was bringing up a lot and but ultimately I think on the back of everything that happened last year my mental health was in the pits really and coming to terms again with having a chronic illness having a massive flare-up having to take a high dose of steroids changing my medication from an injection to a tablet and talking about it talking to it talking about it to my family to my friends to explaining things my symptoms all that is complete like traumatise me in a way I guess but what I wanted to say and just to get down to the point and tell me rabbitting on is if you are struggling and therapy really helps me and I think that's the only thing that will help me in the future and I've tried medication before and friends depressants for anxiety and depression and some of them work quite well some of them don't but I think for me at the moment therapy is what works but yeah and if you are struggling and you are you've recently been diagnosed with a chronic health condition or you've had it for quite a while and you're struggling or you've had surgery or you're in a flare any of those things like try and reach out to someone if you feel like you need to speak to somebody like I get it you might not want to right now and you might just want to bury it and not even think about it because that's what I did for so long but honestly if you kind of address things head on in the long run it is better I think so anyway but anyway have a lovely 2024 again I hope it's very happy and healthy peace out,ive tried to record a video probably five times this morning and ive not been able to do it like for some reason like im not very good

mental health was in the pits really and coming to terms again with having a chronic illness having a massive flareup having to take a high dose of steroids changing my medication from an injection to a tablet and talking about it talking to it talking about it to my family to my friends to explaining things my symptoms all that is complete like traumatise me in a way i guess but what i wanted to say and just to get down to the point and tell me rabbitting on is if you are struggling and therapy really helps me and i think thats the only thing that will help me in the future and ive tried medication before and friends depressants for anxiety and depression and some of them work quite well some of them dont but i think for me at the moment therapy is what works but yeah and if you are struggling and you are youve recently been diagnosed with a chronic health condition or youve had it for quite a while and youre struggling or youve had surgery or youre in a flare any of those things like try and reach out to someone if you feel like you need to speak to somebody like i get it you might not want to right now and you might just want to bury it and not even think about it because thats what i did for so long but honestly if you kind of address things head on in the long run it is better i think so anyway but anyway have a lovely 2024 again i hope its very happy and healthy

Quando chegou a época da adolescência, ela tinha lesões predominantemente nas dobras, dobrinha do cutuvelo, dobrinha do braço. Na adolescência os sintomas pioraram, tornaram graves e aí ela teve que fazer uso de muno supressor, método trexato, ciclosporina e eventualmente com a gravidade da doença. Em 2020 ela iniciou o tratamento com o do pilomab. Como ela engravidou, ela teve que interromper o tratamento apesar de estar indo tudo bem. A dermatite respondeu nas primeiras aplicações e aí ela interrompeu por conta da gestação e no pós-parto então ela voltou com o uso da medicação. Só que com esse retorno ela não percebeu o benefício. A dermatite parecia estar muito grave e ela veio para mim. Minha filha está puxando o celular aqui e ela veio para mim como uma paciente que seria refratária ao uso do do pilomab, como se estivesse parado de fazer efeito. Conclusão, gente, a paciente não era refratária.

It's been a long week and I think the bags under my eyes are a problem to estimate to how long a week it's been for me. Medication side effects. How much do we actually talk about and understand the impact of biologic jacquen hibbers on our bodies. I currently have no active inflammation but I am still so fatigued and just really struggling and I think I had that kind of burst of enthusiasm and energy when the consultant told me that and I was like yes right we're on the road to remission and then I had a chat with a colleague today who is very aware of the medication that I'm on and of IBD. She's like Jennifer stop being so hard on yourself. You know at the end of the day you are on a medication that alters your immune system, it alters your response to things. A side effect is tiredness and fatigue headaches which is what I've had this week. To the point where I haven't really left the house. I know we're told about side effects but again it's that bit of guilt that to the outside world you should be feeling better. Your medication's working so why are you not feeling better? And I think that's a discussion I've had myself this week. It wasn't until today and as I say speaking to a colleague that I was like okay chill just chill. Like my voice is going and it's not because of a cold. I do think this is because of the medication and this happened on Adelaune Mab as well and I'm a little bit worried about that because that was a sign of the drug starting to take a negative effect on my health so I need to keep an eye on all the little things that I'm experiencing just now and just log it. I'm lucky that I am part of a study at the moment where I'm getting reviewed every three months so my blood's in fecal carbotex and I'll be taken and analyzed every three months so if the medication does stop working we should have kind of sight of that pretty quickly so that is the only saving grace. It doesn't stop me like I'm rubbing my hands and I know I actually watched back my video from the other night and I was rubbing my hands and that's a sign for me that I'm feeling anxious. Just around is it working? Like I don't know if it is. Do any of you lovely people out there have experience of specifically opadocytinib and that hydration from 45 to 30 milligrams? You know how did it go for you? Where you see inside effects starting to keep back in? Is it just paranoia on my part? I don't think it is like I know my body. Yeah I think it's just another sign to slow down and listen and do what I can and not be ridiculous about it. Thank you if you made it to the end of this. I think it's just a kind of note for me to say listen to your body you know we take all sorts of concoctions of medication that do all sorts of things to our system and I think it's really really important that you log and I think that's my tip is logging your symptoms when they happen what they are are their triggers you know as they're trying to see if there's a pattern to things so that's what I've started this week but yeah we'll run it out.",hello my fellow ipd and chronic illness warriors its been a long week and i think the bags under my eyes are a problem to estimate to how long a week its been for me medication side effects how much do we actually talk about and understand the impact of biologic jacquen hibbers on our bodies i currently have no active inflammation but i am still so fatigued and just really struggling and i think i had that kind of burst of enthusiasm and energy when the consultant told me that and i was like yes right were on the road to remission and then i had a chat with a colleague today who is very aware of the medication that im on and of ibd shes like jennifer stop being so hard on yourself you know at the end of the day you are on a medication that alters your immune system it alters your response to things a side effect is tiredness and fatigue headaches which is what ive had this week to the point where i havent really left the house i know were told about side effects but again its that bit of guilt that to the outside world you should be feeling better your medications working so why are you not feeling better and i think thats a discussion ive had myself this week it wasnt until today and as i say speaking to a colleague that i was like okay chill just chill like my voice is going and its not because of a cold i do think this is because of the medication and this happened on adelaune mab as well and im a little bit worried about that because that was a sign of the drug starting to take a negative effect on my health so i need to keep an eye on all the little things that im experiencing just now and just log it im lucky that i am part of a study at the moment where im getting reviewed every three months so my bloods in fecal carbotex and ill be taken and analyzed every three months so if the medication does stop working we should have kind of sight of that pretty quickly so that is the only saving grace it doesnt stop me like im rubbing my hands and i know i actually watched back my video from the other night and i was rubbing my hands and thats a sign for me that im feeling anxious just around is it working like i dont know if it is do any of you lovely people out there have experience of specifically opadocytinib and that hydration from 45 to 30 milligrams you know how did it go for you where you see inside effects starting to keep back in is it just paranoia on my part i dont think it is like i know my body yeah i think its just another sign to slow down and listen and do what i can and not be ridiculous about it thank you if you made it to the end of this i think its just a kind of note for me to say listen to your body you know we take all sorts of concoctions of medication that do all sorts of things to our system and i think its really really important that you log and i think thats my tip is logging your symptoms when they happen what they are are their triggers you know as theyre trying to see if theres a pattern to things so thats what ive started this week but yeah well run it out,https://www.tiktok.com/@jen_netball/video/7341716838960663840,Thank you I needed to hear this 🫶🏻 when you’ve no active ‘flare’ you feel you should have more energy and feel better but it’s not that easy it 1/2,thank you i needed to hear this when youve no active flare you feel you should have more energy and feel better but its not that easy it 12,en,1.0,3.0,Amy,amyc1004,7.341716838960664e+18,biologicimmunosuppressant medicafion side effects are they worth it ibd ibdawareness upadacitinib crohnsdisease crohns inflammatoryboweldisease chronicillness adalimumab rinvoqsideeffects rinvoq ulcerativecolitis colitis spoonie spoontheory biologicmedication jakinhibitors fyp fyp fypviral,0,0,0,0,0,Negative,-1,"The patient with chronic illness and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is experiencing fatigue and struggling with the side effects of JAK inhibitors.

Well, hasn't this been a week of balancing my spoons? Before I go into how I've balanced my spoons this week and what I have and haven't done, for those of you that maybe don't have a chronic illness or aren't aware of what spoon theory is, it's a theory that a lot of chronic illness warriors use to explain to people who don't have a chronic illness and how we manage our energy. So for example, I wake up on a day with 10 spoons, if I decide to shower that takes me down 4 spoons, I then decide to have my breakfast, that uses a spoon that leaves me 5 spoons for the rest of the day and we're not even at lunchtime. So yeah, it's a way of us quantifying our energy levels. And I kind of, here you are, here's our spoons, I hope you understand how tired we actually are. I would say I've been feeling pretty okay for about 2 months, not amazing, but more spoons than I've had for a long time this week. Well, today, Friday is the first day in 3 days that I've had a shower because I just haven't had the energy or as spoon theory goes I haven't had enough spoons. And I think it's important as people with chronic illnesses that we recognise that and that we do prioritise, like it was more important for me this week that I got through the working day. So if I had showered every morning, I probably would have been struggling by lunchtime to complete my work. I work from home and that works out perfectly for me, I have a flexible working agreement because of my Crohn's. I can take naps at lunchtime, you know, I can take flex if I need to to finish early. So yeah, I have that flexibility in my job to do that. And I suppose I kind of wonder how I managed that when I didn't have that flexibility and I almost take it for granted now. And I just reach, like my heart goes out to anyone out there who's trying to hold down like a physical full time out of the house job and juggle your spoons because hats off to you, like I don't know how, I don't know how I did it and I can't even put myself back in that situation again. So yeah, feeling thankful that I'm in a job that allows me to do that and allows me to be as flexible as that but also feeling for people who are going through similar to me and can't do that and need to just push through like high five because it's tough going.",hello my fellow ibd and chronic illness warriors well hasnt this been a week of balancing my spoons before i go into how ive balanced my spoons this week and what i have and havent done for those of you that maybe dont have a chronic illness or arent aware of what spoon theory is its a theory that a lot of chronic illness warriors use to explain to people who dont have a chronic illness and how we manage our energy so for example i wake up on a day with 10 spoons if i decide to shower that takes me down 4 spoons i then decide to have my breakfast that uses a spoon that leaves me 5 spoons for the rest of the day and were not even at lunchtime so yeah its a way of us quantifying our energy levels and i kind of here you are heres our spoons i hope you understand how tired we actually are i would say ive been feeling pretty okay for about 2 months not amazing but more spoons than ive had for a long time this week well today friday is the first day in 3 days that ive had a shower because i just havent had the energy or as spoon theory goes i havent had enough spoons and i think its important as people with chronic illnesses that we recognise that and that we do prioritise like it was more important for me this week that i got through the working day so if i had showered every morning i probably would have been struggling by lunchtime to complete my work i work from home and that works out perfectly for me i have a flexible working agreement because of my crohns i can take naps at lunchtime you know i can take flex if i need to to finish early so yeah i have that flexibility in my job to do that and i suppose i kind of wonder how i managed that when i didnt have that flexibility and i almost take it for granted now and i just reach like my heart goes out to anyone out there whos trying to hold down like a physical full time out of the house job and juggle your spoons because hats off to you like i dont know how i dont know how i did it and i cant even put myself back in that situation again so yeah feeling thankful that im in a job that allows me to do that and allows me to be as flexible as that but also feeling for people who are going through similar to me and cant do that and need to just push through like high five because its tough going,https://www.tiktok.com/@jen_netball/video/7341837284909518113,"Some days are harder than others, I can relate to everything you said, hope tomorrow is a better day 😊",some days are harder than others i can relate to everything you said hope tomorrow is a better day,en,1.0,0.0,Daisy Duck,daisy.duck58,7.341837284909518e+18,balancing spoons is never easy ibd ibdawareness upadacitinib crohnsdisease crohns inflammatoryboweldisease chronicillness adalimumab rinvoqsideeffects rinvoq ulcerativecolitis colitis spoonie spoontheory jakinhibitors biologicmedication fyp fyp fypviral,0,0,0,0,0,Neutral,0,"The patient describes using the ""spoon theory"" to manage their energy levels due to their chronic illness.

7.413145638176998e+18,"Almost one year ago, I started having regular infusions at hospital to try managing my Crohn’s disease using biological medicines. For many people, biologics are successful in achieving and maintaining IBD remission. In my particular case, they just haven’t worked well enough this time. Unfortuntely, I’m not well enough to wait any longer to see whether it would eventually start to work. Perhaps I will go back to biologics one day, or maybe they just aren’t the one for me.  But, I now know my new treatment plan! In a few weeks, I will be starting a JAK inhibitor called, Upadacitinib. This is a tablet which I will take daily and need regular blood monitoring for. After almost 5 years of limited response to treatments, I’m hoping this could be the one to finally get my Crohn’s inflammation under control.  Have you tried biologics or JAK inhibitors for IBD?

7.413145917895886e+18,"Almost one year ago, I started having regular infusions at hospital to try managing my Crohn’s disease using biological medicines. For many people, biologics are successful in achieving and maintaining IBD remission. In my particular case, they just haven’t worked well enough this time. Unfortuntely, I’m not well enough to wait any longer to see whether it would eventually start to work. Perhaps I will go back to biologics one day, or maybe they just aren’t the one for me.  But, I now know my new treatment plan! In a few weeks, I will be starting a JAK inhibitor called, Upadacitinib. This is a tablet which I will take daily and need regular blood monitoring for. After almost 5 years of limited response to treatments, I’m hoping this could be the one to finally get my Crohn’s inflammation under control.  Have you tried biologics or JAK inhibitors for IBD?
